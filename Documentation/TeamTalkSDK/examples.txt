 * @section jteamtalk TeamTalk Java client as console application (jTeamTalk)
 *
 * This sample application applies to the following plaforms:
 *
 * - TeamTalk 5 SDK Standard Edition
 *   - Mac OS X
 *   - Linux
 *   - Windows
 * - TeamTalk 5 SDK Professional Edition
 *   - Mac OS X

 *
 * This sample application is located in the SDK's folder:
 * - @c Client/jTeamTalk
 *
 * This example is a TeamTalk client application which runs as a
 * console application.
 *
 * The jTeamTalk example application is a very basic example of how
 * the TeamTalk client works. Here's what it does:
 *
 * 1. Configure sound devices
 * 2. Connect to a TeamTalk server
 * 3. Perform logon to TeamTalk server
 * 4. Join a channel
 *
 * @section teamtalkandroid TeamTalk Java client for Android (TeamTalkAndroid)
 *
 * This sample application applies to the following plaforms:
 *
 * - TeamTalk 5 SDK Standard Edition
 *   - Android
 * - TeamTalk 5 SDK Professional Edition
 *   - Android
 *
 * This sample application is located in the SDK's folder:
 * - @c Client/TeamTalkAndroid
 *
 * This is a TeamTalk client example for Android. The easiest way to
 * get this example running is to use Android Studio 2.1 or later.
 *
 * In Android Studio navigate to the TeamTalkAndroid project located
 * in @c Client/TeamTalkAndroid.

 *
 * The Android Studio should look like this after opening.

 *
 * The TeamTalk 5 JNI library (@c libTeamTalk5-jni.so) for the example
 * project is located in @c
 * Client/TeamTalkAndroid/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a. This is
 * the same file as is located in @c
 * Library/TeamTalkJNI/libs/armeabi-v7a
 *
 * The TeamTalk 5 jar file which loads the TeamTalk 5 JNI library is
 * located in @c Client/TeamTalkAndroid/libs. This is the same
 * file as is located in @c Library/TeamTalkJNI/libs and the source
 * code for the jar file is located in @c Library/TeamTalkJNI/src
 *
 * @section netexample TeamTalk .NET client example using Windows Forms (TeamTalkApp.NET)
 *
 * This sample application applies to the following plaforms:
 *
 * - TeamTalk 5 SDK Standard Edition
 *   - Windows
 * - TeamTalk 5 SDK Professional Edition
 *   - Windows
 *
 * This sample application is located in the SDK's folder:
 * - @c Client/TeamTalkApp.NET
 *
 * This example shows how to connect to a server and join channels
 * where it's possible to stream audio and video data to other users.
 *
 * To build the example start Visual Studio 2010 or later and open the
 * file @c TeamTalk.NET.csproj. Once opened notice the configuration
 * says @c x86 and not @c "Any CPU" as it usually does in .NET
 * projects. This is because the .NET DLL is compiled to run on
 * x86. On Windows x64 Visual Studio will automatically build
 * applications for x64 execution. In order to run the example the
 * working directory for the debugger must be set to the @c
 * Library/TeamTalk_DLL directory of the SDK (where the native
 * TeamTalk5 DLL is located). This is done in the project settings as
 * shown in the picture below:
 *
 * @image html netdebug.png Debugging .NET example
 *
 * Now build the example and run the application.
 *
 * Before connecting to a server press "File -> Preferences" to set up
 * your audio and video devices. Once this is done press "File ->
 * Connect" and connect to a TeamTalk server. To join a channel
 * right-click it in the tree view and click "Join Channel". Below is
 * shown an example of the .NET example in use.

 *
 * Before building your own .NET application ensure to read the
 * section @ref clientsetup.
 *
 * @section ttserverlognet TeamTalk .NET Server Activity Logger Example (ttserverlog.net)
 *
 * This sample application applies to the following plaforms:
 *
 * - TeamTalk 5 SDK Standard Edition
 *   - Windows
 * - TeamTalk 5 SDK Professional Edition
 *   - Windows
 *
 * This sample application is located in the SDK's folder:
 * - @c Client/ttserverlog.net
 *
 * This is a simple console application which stores all audio sent to
 * the server to a specific directory on disk. It also displays all
 * user text chat sessions, file uploads, etc. This example gives a
 * good idea of how events are processed in TeamTalk when using the
 * pool mechanism instead of having events posted to a Windows Forms
 * application.
 *
 * @section qtexample TeamTalk Qt Client Example (qtTeamTalk)
 *
 * This sample application applies to the following plaforms:
 *
 * - TeamTalk 5 SDK Standard Edition
 *   - Mac OS X
 *   - Linux
 *   - Windows
 * - TeamTalk 5 SDK Professional Edition
 *   - Mac OS X
 *   - Linux
 *   - Windows
 *
 * This sample application is located in the SDK's folder:
 * - @c Client/qtTeamTalk
 *
 * This guide explains how to build the TeamTalk Qt client example
 * using Qt Creator and the Qt SDK for Windows 32-bit MinGW. The Qt
 * SDK can be downloaded from <a
 * href="http://www.qt.io">qt.io</a> and the Qt SDK
 * includes Qt Creator.
 *
 * Once installed start Qt Creator and open the project file:
 * @c Client/qtTeamTalk/teamtalk5.pro or @c
 * Client/qtTeamTalk/teamtalk5pro.pro for the Professional
 * Edition of the SDK.
 *
 * Qt Creator will now ask to configure the project:
 *
 * @image html qtcreator_conf.png Configure Qt Project
 *
 * Press <i>Configure Project</i> and the TeamTalk project will now be opened:
 *
 * @image html qtcreator_opened.png Opened Qt Project
 *
 * Now click the hammer icon in the bottom left of the toolbar to
 * build the project and wait for the build process to complete. Once
 * completed click the @a Projects icon in the left toolbar and then
 * the @a Run tab. Specify the <i>Working directory</i> to point to the
 * location of the C-API DLL file:
 *
 * @image html qtcreator_run.png Run Qt Project
 *
 * Finally press the play icon in the left toolbar to run the
 * application.
