 * @defgroup initclient Client Initialization
 *
 * @brief This section explains how to instantiate a new client
 * instance and query its current state.
 *
 * To instantiate a client in TeamTalk 5 SDK Standard Edition call the
 * constructor TeamTalk5.TeamTalk5() and in TeamTalk 5 Professional
 * Edition call TeamTalk5Pro.TeamTalk5Pro(). In both cases the
 * constructor has the parameter @a poll_events which should be
 * 'false' for Windows Forms applications and 'true' for console
 * applications. The @a poll_events parameter tells how the client
 * instance should post its events. Since a Windows Forms application
 * has its own message-loop it does not need to "poll" for
 * events. This is, however, needed by console applications which
 * should call TeamTalkBase.GetMessage() to get events.
 *
 * When a new client instance is created a user application can call
 * to TeamTalkBase.GetFlags() to query the client instance's current
 * state. Initially the client instance's state will be #ClientFlag
 * #ClientFlag.CLIENT_CLOSED. This means that no operation has been performed on
 * the client.
 *
 * @defgroup sounddevices Sound Capture and Playback
 *
 * @brief This section explains how to record and playback audio
 * in the client instance.
 *
 * Before being able to initialize the sound devices to use for
 * recording and playback the computer's available sound devices must
 * first be queried. This is done using the functions
 * TeamTalkBase.GetSoundInputDevices() and
 * TeamTalkBase.GetSoundOutputDevices(). These two functions return arrays
 * of #BearWare.SoundDevice-structs which contains a description of
 * the sound device. In the #BearWare.SoundDevice-struct there's a
 * member variable called @a nDeviceID. This ID should be passed to
 * the client instance's two sound initialization functions
 * TeamTalkBase.InitSoundInputDevice() and
 * TeamTalkBase.InitSoundOutputDevice(). Once this has been done the
 * TeamTalkBase.GetFlags() call will return a value containing the mask
 * bits #ClientFlag #ClientFlag.CLIENT_SNDINPUT_READY and #ClientFlag
 * #ClientFlag.CLIENT_SNDOUTPUT_READY.
 *
 * A computer's default sound devices can be queried using
 * TeamTalkBase.GetDefaultSoundDevices(). A loop-back test of the selected sound
 * devices can be performed using TeamTalkBase.StartSoundLoopbackTest().
 * 
 * Be aware that the sound devices might fail if e.g. a USB sound
 * device is unplugged while the client is talking in a channel. In
 * this case ensure the application is processing the errors
 * #ClientError.INTERR_SNDINPUT_FAILURE and #ClientError.INTERR_SNDOUTPUT_FAILURE in the
 * TeamTalkBase.OnInternalError() event.
 *
 * Read section @ref transmission to see how to transmit recorded
 * audio to other users.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup videocapture Video Capture and Image Display
 *
 * @brief This section explains how to detect and configure video
 * capture devices.
 *
 * The client is able to capture video and present them to the user
 * application in RGB32-format and transmit the image in encoded
 * format to other users.
 *
 * Sections:
 * - @ref vidcapinit
 * - @ref vidcapdisplay
 *
 * @section vidcapinit Initialize Video Capture Device
 *
 * To capture video the user application must first query the
 * available capture devices by calling TeamTalkBase.GetVideoCaptureDevices(). A
 * #BearWare.VideoCaptureDevice supports a certain number of capture formats
 * each described in the @a videoFormats member of #BearWare.VideoFormat.
 *
 * Once a device has been chosen the TeamTalkBase.InitVideoCaptureDevice()
 * must be called for the client instance to start capturing video
 * frames. Use the @a szDevice member of #BearWare.VideoCaptureDevice
 * as the device identifier for the video capture device and pass a
 * #BearWare.VideoFormat from the @a videoFormats array of
 * #BearWare.VideoCaptureDevice. Check out section @ref codecs on how
 * to configure the video codec.
 *
 * @section vidcapdisplay Display Captured Video
 *
 * When a video frame becomes available the event
 * TeamTalkBase.OnUserVideoCapture() is posted to the application and
 * TeamTalkBase.GetUserVideoFrame() can be used to extract the RGB32
 * image. On Windows it's also possible to call
 * TeamTalkBase.PaintVideoFrame() to make the client instance paint on
 * a @c HWND by getting its HDC.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup codecs Audio and Video Codecs
 *
 * @brief This section explains how to configure audio and video
 * codecs.
 *
 * The client is able to encode audio in <a
 * href="http://www.speex.org">Speex</a> and <a
 * href="http://www.opus-codec.org">OPUS</a> format whereas video can
 * be encoded in <a href="http://www.webmproject.org">WebM</a>
 * format. OPUS is recommended for audio encoding, both for voice and
 * music.
 *
 * Choosing the right codec settings in an end-user application is
 * very important and proper settings depend entirely on the user
 * scenario. Always ensure that the codec settings do not require too
 * much bandwidth and thereby resulting in packetloss causing
 * inaudible conversations and poor video quality. Detecting
 * packetloss can be done using #BearWare.UserStatistics and
 * #BearWare.ClientStatistics.
 *
 * Note that bandwidth usage will be much higher when running in peer
 * to peer mode since each client must then broadcast data to all
 * users instead of having the server forward the audio and video
 * packets. Checkout the section @ref connectivity on the different
 * types of connections.
 * 
 * Every channel must configure which audio codec to use in order for
 * users to be able to talk to each other. The @a audiocodec member of
 * #BearWare.Channel specifies which audio codec
 * (#BearWare.AudioCodec) should be used. A channel does not restrict
 * the video codec (#BearWare.VideoCodec) users are using.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup desktopshare Desktop Sharing
 *
 * @brief This section explains how to use the desktop sharing
 * feature where users can share their desktop applications.
 *
 * A user can transmit a desktop window to other users in a
 * channel by passing the handle of a window to the TeamTalk client
 * instance. The TeamTalk client then converts the window to a bitmap
 * image which is transmitted to the server. The server then forwards
 * the bitmap image to all other users in the channel.
 *
 * To transmit a desktop window the user's #BearWare.UserAccount must
 * have the #UserRight.USERRIGHT_TRANSMIT_DESKTOP.
 *
 * Sections:
 * - @ref desktoptx
 *   - @ref desktopwin
 * - @ref desktopshow
 *   - @ref desktopcursor
 * - @ref desktopinput
 *   - @ref rxdesktopinput
 *   - @ref txdesktopinput
 *   - @ref transdesktopinput
 *
 * @section desktoptx Send Desktop Window (or bitmap)
 *
 * Before sending a desktop window to a channel the handle
 * (identifier) of the window to share must first be found. It is,
 * however, possible to simply send a raw bitmap by calling
 * TeamTalkBase.SendDesktopWindow().
 *
 * @subsection desktopwin Windows Desktop Sharing
 *
 * TeamTalk for Windows provides the following functions for
 * obtaining different @c HWNDs:
 *
 * - WindowsHelper.GetDesktopActiveHWND()
 *   - Get the @c HWND of the window which has focus.
 * - WindowsHelper.GetDesktopHWND()
 *   - Get the @c HWND of the Windows desktop.
 * - WindowsHelper.GetDesktopWindowHWND()
 *   - Enumerate all visible windows.
 * - WindowsHelper.GetWindow()
 *   - Get information about a window, e.g. window title, size, etc.
 *
 * Once the @c HWND of the window to share has been found use the
 * following function for sending the window to the channel:
 * 
 * - TeamTalkBase.SendDesktopWindowFromHWND()
 *
 * @section desktopshow Displaying Shared Desktop Window (or bitmap)
 *
 * When a shared desktop window is received the event
 * TeamTalkBase.OnUserDesktopWindow() is posted to the local client
 * instance. TeamTalkBase.AcquireUserDesktopWindow() can then be called to obtain
 * a bitmap image of the shared window.
 *
 * @subsection desktopcursor Desktop Cursor Sharing
 *
 * It is also possible to share the position of the mouse cursor when
 * sharing a desktop window. Use TeamTalkBase.SendDesktopCursorPosition() to
 * transmit the position of the mouse cursor. When the position is
 * received the event #BearWare.TeamTalkBase.OnUserDesktopCursor is posted to the
 * local client instance. TeamTalkBase.GetUserDesktopCursor() can then be used
 * to obtain the cursor position.
 * 
 * @section desktopinput Remote Desktop Access
 *
 * If a user has shared a desktop window it's possible for other users
 * in the same channel to take over control of mouse and keyboard on
 * the computer sharing the desktop window.
 *
 * To access a remote desktop the user's #BearWare.UserAccount must have the
 * #UserRight.USERRIGHT_TRANSMIT_DESKTOPINPUT.
 * 
 * @subsection rxdesktopinput Receive Desktop Input
 *
 * In order for a client instance to allow remote desktop access it is
 * required to first subscribe to desktop input from the user who
 * wants access to the shared desktop window. This is done by calling
 * TeamTalkBase.DoSubscribe() along with the user-id and subscription
 * #Subscription.SUBSCRIBE_DESKTOPINPUT. Once desktop input (mouse or keyboard
 * input) is received from a remote user the
 * TeamTalkBase.OnUserDesktopInput() event will be posted to the client
 * instance. The actual mouse or keyboard input can then be obtained
 * by the client instance using TeamTalkBase.GetUserDesktopInput() which returns
 * a struct of type #BearWare.DesktopInput. Afterwards
 * WindowsHelper.Execute() can be used to execute the mouse or
 * keyboard input.
 *
 * @subsection txdesktopinput Transmit Desktop Input
 * 
 * The remote user who wants to transmit mouse or keyboard input to
 * the user sharing a desktop window can use
 * TeamTalkBase.SendDesktopInput(). Remember that the user sharing the desktop
 * window must have enabled the subscription #Subscription.SUBSCRIBE_DESKTOPINPUT.
 *
 * @subsection transdesktopinput Desktop Input and Keyboard Layouts
 *
 * It can be quite troublesome to handle keyboard input since each
 * key-code depends on the OS and the regional settings on the
 * OS. E.g. on a German keyboard the Z key is located where the Y key
 * is on a US keyboard. The German keyboard also has letters which
 * don't even appear on a US keyboard.
 *
 * Because of the issues with keyboard layouts and regional settings
 * the TeamTalk API provides BearWare.WindowsHelper.DesktopInput_KeyTranslate() which can
 * be used to translate a keyboard's scan-code to an intermediate
 * format. If e.g. a client instance is running Windows then
 * BearWare.WindowsHelper.DesktopInput_KeyTranslate() can be called with
 * #TTKeyTranslate.TTKEY_WINKEYCODE_TO_TTKEYCODE which converts the scan-code on a
 * Windows keyboard to TeamTalk's intermediate format (TTKEYCODE). To
 * be able to execute the key-code once it's received it must be
 * converted back again from TeamTalk's intermediate format to the
 * platform where the application is running. I.e. if the TTKEYCODE is
 * received on a Mac then BearWare.WindowsHelper.DesktopInput_KeyTranslate() must be
 * called with #TTKeyTranslate.TTKEY_TTKEYCODE_TO_MACKEYCODE.
 *
 * @defgroup mediastream Stream Media Files
 *
 * Media files, mp3, avi, wmv, wma, etc. can be streamed to a channel
 * and controlled separately from the voice and video capture
 * input. Streaming a media file requires
 * #UserRight.USERRIGHT_TRANSMIT_MEDIAFILE_AUDIO and/or
 * #UserRight.USERRIGHT_TRANSMIT_MEDIAFILE_VIDEO.
 *
 * The media formats supported by the TeamTalk DLL depends on the
 * platform. On Windows the Windows Media Player's API is used to
 * convert media files to TeamTalk's internal formats (i.e. Speex,
 * OPUS and WebM). So whatever Windows Media Player can play should
 * also be possible to stream using TeamTalkBase. On Mac and Linux avconv
 * is used for converting media files which in similar way makes use
 * of what the platform provides.
 *
 * Use BearWare.TeamTalkBase.GetMediaFileInfo() to see if the media file format is
 * supported and what properties are used for audio and video.
 *
 * To stream a media file to a channel call
 * BearWare.TeamTalkBase.StartStreamingMediaFileToChannel() and to stop the stream call
 * BearWare.TeamTalkBase.StopStreamingMediaFileToChannel(). The user receiving the media
 * stream can control volume levels by calling BearWare.TeamTalkBase.SetUserVolume() and
 * BearWare.TeamTalkBase.AcquireUserMediaVideoFrame() to obtain video frames.
 *
 * Subscription of media files is controlled by #Subscription.SUBSCRIBE_MEDIAFILE.
 *
 * @defgroup events Client Event Handling
 *
 * @brief This section explains how to handle events generated by the
 * client instance.
 *
 * When events occur in the client instance, like e.g. if a new user
 * joins a channel, the client instance invokes an event which the
 * user application must act upon. The message queue for events is
 * limited to 1 MB. If the queue grows above the maximum size then
 * event handling is suspended and will not be resumed until the queue
 * size is again below the maximum size. The event
 * #ClientError.INTERR_TTMESSAGE_QUEUE_OVERFLOW will be posted to the message
 * queue if an overflow has taken place.
 *
 * Note that when an event occurs the TeamTalk client instance doesn't
 * wait for the user application to process the event. So if e.g. a
 * user sends a text-message and immediately after disconnects from
 * the server, then the #BearWare.User, who sent the message, cannot be
 * retrieved using TeamTalkBase.GetUser() since the user is no longer available
 * when the user application starts processing the new text-message
 * event. This is, of course, annoying when designing the user
 * application, but the reason for this design choice it that the
 * client instance is a realtime component which cannot wait for the
 * UI to process data, since audio playback and recording would then
 * be halted.
 *
 * The section @ref stepbystep gives a good idea of how events are
 * processed in a user application.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup errorhandling Client Error Handling
 *
 * @brief This section explains how to handle errors occuring in the
 * client instance or as a result of server commands.
 *
 * There are two types errors which can occur in the client,
 * either server command error or internal errors. Section @ref
 * commands describes all the commands a client can issue to a
 * server. If a server commands fails the client instance notifies the
 * user application through the event TeamTalkBase.OnCmdError(). An
 * example of a server command error could be to issue the TeamTalkBase.DoLogin()
 * command with an incorrect password. The server will in this
 * case respond with the error #ClientError.CMDERR_INVALID_ACCOUNT. The
 * user application must be designed to process these errors so
 * application users can be notified of errors.
 *
 * Internal errors are errors due to failing devices. Currently only
 * two such errors exist #ClientError.INTERR_SNDINPUT_FAILURE and
 * #ClientError.INTERR_SNDOUTPUT_FAILURE.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup connectivity Client/Server Connectivity
 *
 * @brief This section explains how to connect to a server and how the
 * client should transmit voice and video data.
 * 
 * To communicate with a server the TeamTalk client creates
 * both a TCP and UDP connection to the server. Commands, i.e. the
 * @c BearWare.TeamTalkBase.Do*-functions, are sent on TCP whereas audio and video are sent
 * on UDP.
 *
 * To connect to a server the user application must call
 * TeamTalkBase.Connect(). Once connected the event TeamTalkBase.OnConnectSuccess() is
 * posted to the user application and the TeamTalkBase.DoLogin() command can be
 * issued. Always ensure to call TeamTalkBase.Disconnect() before attempting to
 * create a new connection with TeamTalkBase.Connect().
 *
 * When the client instance has joined a channel and wants to transmit
 * audio or video data to other users this can be done in two ways
 * depending on how the user application configures the client. One
 * way is forward through server and the other is peer to peer mode
 * which are explained in the following two sections.
 *
 * @section txforward Forward Through Server Transmission Mode
 *
 * The client instance is sending its audio and video packets to the
 * server and the server will then broadcast the packets to the other
 * users on behalf of the client. In other words the client puts the
 * bandwidth load onto the server. This approach has its advantages
 * and disadvantages. Since most internet users nowadays have 
 * limited upstream they cannot broadcast audio and video packets to
 * numerous users at the same time, so therefore the TeamTalk
 * client makes the server do the broadcasting. This means that
 * the server must have sufficient bandwidth available to handle data
 * transmission from and to all the connected users. One disadvantage
 * by having the server forward the audio and video packets is that it
 * doubles latency, since the client doesn't send directly to other
 * clients.
 *
 * If the server should not allow clients to forward audio and video
 * packets the @a uUserRights member of #BearWare.UserAccount must disable
 * #UserRight.USERRIGHT_TRANSMIT_VOICE and #UserRight.USERRIGHT_TRANSMIT_VIDEOCAPTURE.
 *
 * @defgroup commands Client/Server Commands
 *
 * @brief This section contains the list of commands which can be
 * issued by the client instance to the server.
 *
 * @section cmdprocessing Client/Server Command Processing
 *
 * Functions with the prefix @c Do* are commands which the client can
 * issue to the server. Every @c Do* function returns a command
 * identifier which can user application can use to check when the
 * server has finished processing the issued command. Once the client
 * receives a response to a command the client instance posts the
 * event TeamTalkBase.OnCmdProcessing() to the user application
 * containing the command identifier and whether the command is being
 * processed or it has completed.
 *
 * As an example, say the user application wants to issue the
 * TeamTalkBase.DoLogin() command. When the application calls TeamTalkBase.DoLogin() the
 * returned command ID is stored in a variable. The application then
 * waits for the TeamTalkBase.OnCmdProcessing() event to be posted with
 * the stored command ID. The first time TeamTalkBase.OnCmdProcessing()
 * is posted to the user application it is to say that processing has
 * begun. The second time TeamTalkBase.OnCmdProcessing() is called it is
 * to say that the command has completed. In between the command
 * starting and completing several other events may take place. If
 * e.g. the TeamTalkBase.DoLogin() fails the user application would receive the
 * event TeamTalkBase.OnCmdError(). If on the other hand the command was
 * successful all the channels and user would be posted as events to
 * the application before the login-command completed processing.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup transmission Audio and Video Transmission
 *
 * @brief This section explains how to transmit audio and video to
 * users in a channel.
 *
 * Once the client instance has joined a channel it can transmit
 * audio, video and desktops to other users in the channel.
 *
 * To transmit audio the client must have the flag
 * #ClientFlag #ClientFlag.CLIENT_SNDINPUT_READY enabled which is done in the function
 * TeamTalkBase.InitSoundInputDevice(). To transmit video requires the flag
 * #ClientFlag #ClientFlag.CLIENT_VIDEOCAPTURE_READY which is enabled by the function
 * TeamTalkBase.InitVideoCaptureDevice(). To hear what others users are saying a
 * sound output device must have been configured using
 * TeamTalkBase.InitSoundOutputDevice() and thereby have enabled the flag
 * #ClientFlag #ClientFlag.CLIENT_SNDOUTPUT_READY.
 *
 * Calling TeamTalkBase.EnableVoiceTransmission() will make the client
 * instance start transmitting voice data. Voice transmission can also
 * be activated automatically using voice activation. This is done by
 * called TeamTalkBase.EnableVoiceActivation() and setting a voice
 * activation level using TeamTalkBase.SetVoiceActivationLevel(). Note
 * that voice transmission requires #UserRight.USERRIGHT_TRANSMIT_VOICE.
 *
 * Calling TeamTalkBase.StartVideoCaptureTransmission() will make the client
 * instance start transmission video data from a video capture device
 * (typically a webcam). Note that video capture transmission requires
 * #UserRight.USERRIGHT_TRANSMIT_VIDEOCAPTURE.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup server Server Administration
 *
 * @brief This section explains how to configure a server and setup
 * user accounts.
 *
 * The server keeps track of which users are in which channels
 * and ensures that users in the same channel can communicate with
 * each other. It is also the job of the server to provide user
 * authentication so only users with the proper credentials are
 * allowed to do certain operations.
 *
 * It is a good idea to check out section @ref serversetup to learn
 * how to configure the TeamTalk server.
 *
 * The server's name, message of the day (MOTD) can be updated using
 * the #BearWare.ServerProperties-struct. Only users with
 * #UserRight.USERRIGHT_UPDATE_SERVERPROPERTIES are allowed change a server's
 * properties while it's running. This is done using the command
 * TeamTalkBase.DoUpdateServer().
 *
 * Sections:
 * - @ref useradmin
 * - @ref userban
 *
 * @section useradmin User Administration
 *
 * Two types of users exists on a server, default users
 * (#UserType.USERTYPE_DEFAULT) and administrator users (#UserType.USERTYPE_ADMIN). The
 * #UserType-enum can be used to see who is what. A user of
 * #UserType.USERTYPE_ADMIN have unrestricted rights on the server and can
 * issue any command to the server whereas a default user is limited
 * to the #UserRights which are assigned to the @c uUserRights member
 * of the user's #BearWare.UserAccount.
 *
 * As administrator it is possible to list all users who have an
 * account on the server using TeamTalkBase.DoListUserAccounts(). To
 * create a new user account call the command
 * TeamTalkBase.DoNewUserAccount() and to delete an account call
 * TeamTalkBase.DoDeleteUserAccount().
 *
 * @section userban Kicking and Banning Users
 *
 * Sometimes it may be necessary to kick and ban users from a
 * server. With #UserRight.USERRIGHT_KICK_USERS it is possible to use the
 * command TT_DoKickUser() to kick a user off the server. A channel
 * operator (TT_DoChannelOp()) can also kick a user from a channel
 * (but not off a server).
 *
 * With #UserRight.USERRIGHT_BAN_USERS it is also possible to ban users from the
 * server, so they can no longer log in. This can be done using
 * TT_DoBanUser(). To list who are currently banned call
 * TT_DoListBans() and to remove a ban call TT_DoUnBanUser().
 *
 *
 * @defgroup channels Channel Properties
 *
 * @brief This section explains the concept of channels where users
 * can interact.
 *
 * Users are arranged in a tree structure consisting of
 * channels where each channel can hold a number of users. While
 * in a channel users can transmit audio and video to each other
 * as well as sending channel messages. On a server there will
 * always be a root channel which cannot be deleted.
 *
 * In other conferencing tools channels are also refered to as
 * "rooms".
 *
 * Sections:
 * - @ref chanadmin
 * - @ref filesharing
 * - @ref voicelog
 *
 * @section chanadmin Channel Administration
 *
 * To create a new channel on a server requires
 * #UserRight.USERRIGHT_MODIFY_CHANNELS or #UserRight.USERRIGHT_CREATE_TEMPORARY_CHANNEL.
 *
 * With #UserRight.USERRIGHT_MODIFY_CHANNELS the method TeamTalkBase.DoMakeChannel() can
 * be used to create a new channel and any existing channel can be
 * updated using TeamTalkBase.DoUpdateChannel() and removed by calling
 * TeamTalkBase.DoRemoveChannel(). Basically #UserRight.USERRIGHT_MODIFY_CHANNELS gives
 * unrestricted access to all channels on the server. Also seeing
 * passwords of all channels on the server.
 *
 * With #UserRight.USERRIGHT_CREATE_TEMPORARY_CHANNEL the user can only create
 * temporary channels which disappear when the last user leaves the
 * channel. A temporary channel must be created by calling
 * TeamTalkBase.DoJoinChannel(). Once a user has created a temporary channel and
 * joined it he becomes operator of the channel which means that he
 * can update the channel's properties at any given time.
 * 
 * @section filesharing File Sharing
 *
 * While in a channel users can upload and download files if the
 * #UserRight.USERRIGHT_UPLOAD_FILES and #UserRight.USERRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_FILES are
 * enabled. To upload a file to a channel the channel needs to have a
 * disk quota. The disk quota is specified by @a nDiskQuota in the
 * #BearWare.Channel-struct. The file being uploaded must have a file
 * size which is less than the disk quota and the sum of sizes of
 * existing files. Once a file is uploaded only channel operators and
 * the file's owner can delete a file.
 *
 * Call TeamTalkBase.DoSendFile() to upload a file and
 * TeamTalkBase.DoRecvFile() to download a file. Only users who have
 * a #BearWare.UserAccount on the server are allowed to upload
 * files. There is no limit on the maximum number of file
 * transfers but it is advised to queue file transfers so the file
 * transfers do no affect server performance.
 *
 * @section voicelog Storing Conversations to Audio Files
 *
 * In some applications it may be required to be able to save all
 * audio data received by the client instance to disk. This can be
 * archived by calling TeamTalkBase.SetUserMediaStorageDir() which
 * will then save received audio data in the following format:
 * "YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS \#USERID USERNAME.wav". USERNAME is the @a
 * szUsername from #BearWare.User.
 *
 * To store audio data from outside the local client instance's
 * channel, please read section @ref spying.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup users User Properties
 *
 * @brief This section explains users interact and how to configure
 * user settings.
 *
 * Users can be seen on the server after a successful call
 * to TeamTalkBase.DoLogin(). Once logged in a user can send user to user
 * text-messages using TeamTalkBase.DoTextMessage() as well as receive
 * broadcast messages. A user cannot send audio and video data to
 * other users until they have joined the same channel.
 *
 * Sections:
 * - @ref usertypes
 * - @ref userinteract
 * - @ref uservolume
 * - @ref subscriptions
 *   - @ref spying
 *
 * @section usertypes User Types
 *
 * A user can either be a default user #UserType.USERTYPE_DEFAULT or an
 * administrator #UserType.USERTYPE_ADMIN. A default user has limited rights
 * on the server (see @c uUserRights of #BearWare.UserAccount) whereas an
 * administrator can change server properties, create, delete and
 * remove channels as well as move, kick and ban users. Checkout @ref
 * useradmin on how to set up user rights.
 *
 * @section userinteract User Interaction
 *
 * Once a user has joined a channel it is possible to transmit voice
 * and video data to other users. If a user starts talking in the
 * channel the event TeamTalkBase.OnUserStateChange() is posted to the user
 * application and if a video frame is received the event
 * TeamTalkBase.OnUserVideoFrame() is sent to the user application.
 *
 * @section uservolume User Audio Settings
 *
 * While in the same channel the user application can change different
 * settings on a user. If e.g. a user's volume is too low the user
 * application can call TeamTalkBase.SetUserVolume() to increase the volume. 
 *
 * If on the other hand the user application wants to mute a user
 * TeamTalkBase.SetUserMute() can be used for this. Note that muting a user
 * doesn't mean that the client instance will stop receiving audio
 * from that user, it simply means it will not be played. To stop
 * receiving audio from a user the local client instance must ask the
 * server to unsubscribe audio data from the user. This is explained
 * in the next section.
 *
 * @section subscriptions User Subscriptions
 * 
 * When logging on to a server the local client instance will by
 * default subscribe to user messages, channel messages, broadcast
 * messages, audio data and video data from all users. If,
 * however, a client wants to stop receiving e.g. audio from a
 * user, he can call TeamTalkBase.DoUnsubscribe() along with the user
 * ID and the #Subscription.SUBSCRIBE_VOICE-flag to tell the
 * server that he no longer wants to receive audio from that
 * user. The server will then respond with the event
 * TeamTalkBase.OnCmdUserUpdate() and the @a uLocalSubscriptions
 * member of #BearWare.User will have the
 * #Subscription.SUBSCRIBE_VOICE-flag removed. At the remote user
 * the \a uPeerSubscriptions member will be
 * changed. Subscribe/unsubscribe can also be done for user,
 * channel and broadcast messages and video data. The function
 * TeamTalkBase.DoSubscribe() can be used to revert unsubscriptions.
 *
 * @subsection spying Spying on Users
 *
 * Previously it has been said that users can only receive audio and
 * video from users when they are in the same channel, but actually an
 * administrator user can call TeamTalkBase.DoSubscribe() with the flags prefixed
 * SUBSCRIBE_INTERCEPT_* to spy on users outside his own channel. In
 * other words it's possible hear and see video data outside ones
 * channel. Also all user and channel messages sent by a user can also
 * be intercepted in this way.
 *
 * Having the ability to intercept all data sent from users in any
 * channel means that it's possible to log everything that is
 * happening on the server. Both audio and video transfers as well
 * as text messaging. Checkout TeamTalkBase.SetUserMediaStorageDir()
 * on how to store voice data to audio files.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup hotkey Windows Hotkeys
 *
 * @brief This section explains how to setup hot-keys on Windows.
 *
 * Hotkeys can be used to e.g. enable push-to-talk.
 *
 * Windows supports intercepting key strokes globally, i.e. without
 * having the user application's window focused. To investigate which
 * keys are currently being pressed the function
 * TeamTalkBase.HotKey_InstallTestHook() can be used. Once the desired
 * key-combination has been found the function TeamTalkBase.HotKey_Register() can
 * be used to register the combination as a hotkey and have the
 * TeamTalkBase.OnHotKeyToggle() event posted whenever the key combination
 * becomes active.
 *
 * Note that it's not advised to have a hotkey installed while
 * debugging an application in Visual Studio. It slows down the
 * debugger dramatically.
 *

 * To find the mixer which is associated with the current sound input
 * or output device the @a nWaveDeviceID member of #BearWare.SoundDevice must
 * be used when querying the mixer.

 * @defgroup firewall Windows Firewall
 *
 * @brief This section explains how to configure the Windows firewall
 * available in Windows XP SP2 and later.
 *
 * The Windows Firewall can be modified so applications can be
 * added to the firewall's exception list.
 *
 * The Windows Firewall was introduced in Windows XP SP2. Modifying
 * the Windows Firewall requires administrator rights. On Windows XP
 * the user running the application, which calls the DLL, is assumed
 * to have administrator rights. On Windows Vista/7 the DLL will
 * automatically call User Account Control (UAC) to obtain
 * administrator rights.
 *
 * Check out #BearWare.WindowsFirewall class on how to add
 * application executables to the Windows Firewall exception list.
 *
 * @defgroup serverapi TeamTalk Server API
 *
 * @brief Instantiate and run a TeamTalk server.
 *
 * The Professional Edition of the TeamTalk SDK includes a class 
 * called #BearWare.TeamTalk5Srv which exposes the TeamTalk server API.
 *
 * To create a TeamTalk server instantiate the #BearWare.TeamTalk5Srv
 * class. If the server should be encrypted then call
 * TeamTalk5Srv.SetEncryptionContext() prior to the instantiation,
 * since the SSL context must be available before instantiation of the
 * server.
 *
 * Next configure the server instance by calling
 * TeamTalk5Srv.UpdateServer(). Remember to set all properties of
 * #BearWare.ServerProperties. Also create a root channel by calling
 * TeamTalk5Srv.MakeChannel(). If there is no root channel then the
 * server will not start. Finally call TeamTalk5Srv.StartServer() to
 * start the server. Now you must continuesly call
 * TeamTalk5Srv.RunEventLoop() to run the server event loop.
 *
 * The TeamTalk server API is able to do callbacks when users perform
 * certain events. There are two types of callbacks, one is @ref
 * serverlogevents and the other is @ref servercallbacks where the server
 * is asking the server application on what to return to the user (a
 * #BearWare.ClientErrorMsg is provided by the server API which will be
 * returned to the user).
 *
 * To see a simple example application of a TeamTalk server check
 * out @ref ttservernet.
 *
 * @defgroup servercallbacks Server Request Callbacks
 *
 * @brief Handle user requests to the server.
 *
 * Callbacks of this type are invoked when a client application has
 * issued a command to the server, basically called a @c TeamTalkBase.Do*
 * method (one example could be TeamTalkBase.DoLogin()).
 *
 * To get a callback when a user wants to log in listen for event
 * TeamTalk5Srv.OnUserLogin(). If the user should be allowed to log on
 * pass #ClientError.CMDERR_SUCCESS to the #BearWare.ClientErrorMsg provided by the
 * TeamTalk server API. If not pass any another value which will then
 * be returned to the client application.
 *
 * @defgroup serverlogevents Server Notification Callbacks
 *
 * @brief Notification events for server changes.
 *
 * Callbacks of this type are mainly meant for logging so it's
 * possible to see what is going on the server. Examples of logging
 * events are when a user is dropped due to connection timeout.
