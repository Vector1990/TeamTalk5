# TeamTalk 5 Classic for Accessibility {#classic}

The default TeamTalk 5 client application uses a framework called
[Qt](http://qt-project.org) for designing the user interface and
unfortunately this doesn't work well with screen-readers. For this
reason a simplified version of the TeamTalk 5 application has been
included with the TeamTalk 5 Windows installer called **TeamTalk 5
Classic** which works well with screen-readers.

# Install TeamTalk 5 Classic {#installclassic}

To install TeamTalk 5 Classic for accessibility run the installer and
in the "Select Components" page choose "TeamTalk 5 Classic for
Accessibility".

When running the TeamTalk 5 Classic client it looks as follows:

 "TeamTalk 5 Classic")

The keyboard menu shortcuts are the same in the Classic client as in
the regular client. The Classic client doesn't have a [Video-tab](@ref videotab)
and [Desktop-tab](@ref desktoptab). Video and desktop
sessions are opened in separate windows when running the Classic
client. To ignore video and desktop session completely look into
[Default Subscriptions](@ref connectiontab).
