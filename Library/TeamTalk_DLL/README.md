# TeamTalk C-API header files and libraries

Copy TeamTalk.h (and TeamTalkSrv.h in TeamTalk 5 Professional SDK) to
this directory along with the libraries. The files are located in the
`Library/TeamTalk_DLL` folder of the [TeamTalk 5
SDK](http://bearware.dk/?page_id=419).

TeamTalk.h contains the API for creating a TeamTalk client
application.

TeamTalkSrv.h contains the API for creating a TeamTalk server
application. The TeamTalk server API is only available in [TeamTalk 5
Professional Edition](http://bearware.dk/?page_id=419).
