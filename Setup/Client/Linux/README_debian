TeamTalk 5 for Debian 9
-----------------------

TeamTalk 5 runs on Debian 9 using ALSA sound system for audio and
Video4Linux2 (V4L2) for video capture.

When joining or creating a channel on a server then ensure that your
audio input and output devices support the sample rate used by the
channel, otherwise you'll get an audio device failure.


Dependencies
------------

In order to run TeamTalk the following dependencies must be
installed first:

- libqt5x11extras5
- libqt5webenginewidgets5
- libqt5webenginecore5
- libqt5quick5
- libqt5widgets5
- libqt5multimedia5
- libqt5gui5
- libqt5webchannel5
- libqt5qml5
- libqt5network5
- libqt5xml5
- libqt5core5a
- libasound2

To install the packages run the following command as 'root':

apt install libqt5x11extras5 libqt5webenginewidgets5 \
libqt5webenginecore5 libqt5quick5 libqt5widgets5 \
libqt5multimedia5 libqt5gui5 libqt5webchannel5 \
libqt5qml5 libqt5network5 libqt5xml5 libqt5core5a libasound2

Run TeamTalk
------------

Use the run.sh script to start the TeamTalk client. The run.sh script
includes the shared library (libTeamTalk.so) dependency in the library
path.


Known Issues
------------

There are still a couple of issues which needs to be fixed in the
TeamTalk client before it runs smoothly on Linux. These are listed
here:

- Modifier keys alone cannot be used as hotkeys. Hotkeys needs to be
  either a regular key or a regular key and a modifier key. F12 seems
  like a good key to use as a PTT key on Linux when using KDE.

- Streaming video flickers sometimes
