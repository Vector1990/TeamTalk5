TeamTalk 5 Professional Server for Windows
-------------------------------------------

TeamTalk 5 Professional Server works pretty much the same as the
TeamTalk 5 Server included with the TeamTalk 5 distribution. The only
difference is the following features in the TeamTalk 5 Professional
Server:

- Support for encrypted connection between clients and server
- Support for BearWare WebLogin


Quick Guide
-----------

Here's a quick introduction on how to set up a TeamTalk 5 Professional
Server which uses encrypted connections and BearWare.dk WebLogins.

Setting up encryption requires a tool called OpenSSL. OpenSSL for
Windows can be downloaded from this website: https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries

Locate openssl.exe in the installation folder and use it as a
reference onwards.

First create a server certificate and private key for your TeamTalk
server by running the following command:

$ openssl.exe req -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout ttserverkey.pem -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -out ttservercert.pem -outform PEM

Remember the location of the generated private key file
"ttserverkey.pem" and certificate file "ttservercert.pem".


Now run the TeamTalk 5 Professional Server's setup wizard:

$ ./tt5prosrv.exe -wizard

When asked "Should server run in encrypted mode?" answer "Y".

The wizard will then ask you for the server's certificate file. Here
you write the location of "ttservercert.pem".

Next the wizard will ask for the server's private key file. Here you
write the location of "ttserverkey.pem".


Next up is creating the BearWare.dk WebLogin account. This account can
be created when the wizard asks to create user accounts.

Select the option "Create BearWare.dk web-login account" to enable
BearWare.dk WebLogin. The BearWare.dk WebLogin account is name
"bearware" and is a general account for all users who log on to your
server with a BearWare.dk WebLogin account.


Complete the remaining wizard items in the wizard and you're ready to
start your server:

$ ./tt5prosrv.exe -nd -verbose

To run the server as an service, so you can log out of your session,
run:

$ tt5prosvc_install.bat

If you have any troubles look in the following trouble shooting
section.
